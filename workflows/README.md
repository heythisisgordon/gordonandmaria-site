# Cline Workflows for Human-Centered Systems

This directory contains specialized Cline workflows designed to streamline development, maintain code quality, and ensure professional-grade issue resolution for the Human-Centered Systems website and Vibe Coding 101 workshop platform.

## Quick Start

**New to the project?** Start here:
1. Use `/next-issue.md` to find the highest priority work
2. Use `/analyze-issue.md` to thoroughly understand the issue
3. Use `/implement-clean.md` to plan clean, reusable code
4. Use `/fix-lifecycle.md` to execute and validate the complete solution

- Incremental testing and validation
- Comprehensive quality assurance
- GitHub issue closure with documentation

### üîß Specialized Workflows

#### [`survey-code.md`](./survey-code.md) - Codebase Health Analysis
**When to use**: Periodic code quality reviews or before major refactoring

- Legacy code review and modernization opportunities
- Overengineering assessment and simplification recommendations
- Technical debt prioritization and improvement planning

#### [`quick-bug.md`](./quick-bug.md) - Fast Bug Reporting
**When to use**: When discovering bugs during development work
- Rapid bug documentation without losing focus
- Consistent bug report formatting
- Priority assessment and impact analysis
- Integration with current development workflow

#### [`workshop-deploy.md`](./workshop-deploy.md) - Workshop Environment Management
**When to use**: Issues affecting Vibe Coding 101 workshop infrastructure
- Workshop-safe deployment planning
- Container and demo environment validation
- Student experience impact assessment
- Educational demonstration continuity assurance

## Workflow Integration

### Typical Development Flow
```
Start ‚Üí /next-issue.md ‚Üí /analyze-issue.md ‚Üí /implement-clean.md ‚Üí /fix-lifecycle.md ‚Üí Complete

Bug Discovery ‚Üí /quick-bug.md ‚Üí Priority Assessment ‚Üí /analyze-issue.md (if critical) ‚Üí Resolution
```

## Key Features

### üîó GitHub Integration
All workflows leverage GitHub MCP tools for:
- Real-time issue fetching and analysis
- Automated issue creation and updates
- Comment addition and status tracking
- Label management and prioritization

### üéØ Single-Issue Focus
Every workflow emphasizes:
- Working on one issue at a time
- Avoiding scope creep and feature drift
- Complete resolution before moving to next task
- Thorough testing and validation

### üèóÔ∏è Code Quality Emphasis
Built-in quality assurance through:
- Pattern consistency enforcement
- Code reuse maximization
- Simplification over complexity
- Professional-grade documentation

### üéì Workshop Awareness
Special consideration for:
- Educational demonstration requirements
- Student experience continuity
- Container infrastructure stability
- Live workshop deployment safety

## Usage Guidelines

### Choosing the Right Workflow

**For Regular Development:**
- Start with `/next-issue.md` to find work
- Always use `/analyze-issue.md` for understanding
- Use `/implement-clean.md` for quality planning
- Complete with `/fix-lifecycle.md` for validation

**For Code Quality Reviews:**
- Use `/survey-code.md` for comprehensive analysis
- Follow up with regular development workflows for fixes

**For Bug Discovery:**
- Use `/quick-bug.md` for immediate documentation
- Escalate to analysis workflows if critical

**For Workshop Issues:**
- Use `/workshop-deploy.md` for specialized handling
- Integrate with other workflows as needed

### Best Practices

1. **Read the Workflow**: Each workflow includes detailed steps and examples
2. **Follow the Sequence**: Workflows are designed to build on each other
3. **Use GitHub Integration**: Leverage MCP tools for real-time data
4. **Focus on Quality**: Prioritize clean, maintainable code
5. **Document Everything**: Maintain clear records of decisions and changes

### Integration with Cline Rules
