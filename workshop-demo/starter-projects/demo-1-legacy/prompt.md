## Cline AI Prompt

```
I want to modernize this legacy 1990s-style website into a modern React application. Please analyze the existing code in starter-projects/demo-1-legacy/index.html and:

1. **Convert to Modern React**:
   - Transform this jQuery/HTML website into a clean React application
   - Use modern React hooks (useState, useEffect) instead of jQuery
   - Create reusable components for navigation, sections, and forms
   - Implement proper component state management

2. **Modern UI/UX Design**:
   - Replace the dated 1990s styling with modern, professional design
   - Add smooth animations and transitions between sections
   - Implement responsive design that works perfectly on mobile
   - Use modern color schemes and typography
   - Add subtle shadows, gradients, and modern spacing

3. **Enhanced Functionality**:
   - Make the navigation smooth with proper routing
   - Add form validation with real-time feedback
   - Include loading states and success animations
   - Add a "live chat" widget simulation
   - Create hover effects and micro-interactions

4. **Professional Features**:
   - Add a hero section with call-to-action buttons
   - Include testimonials or client logos section
   - Create a services showcase with icons
   - Add a modern footer with social links
   - Include accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

5. **Deploy Ready**:
   - Set up the project structure properly
   - Ensure all assets and dependencies are included
   - Create a production-ready build
   - Test all functionality works smoothly

Transform this legacy business website into something that looks like it was built in 2025, not 1995! Show me the before/after comparison when you're done.
